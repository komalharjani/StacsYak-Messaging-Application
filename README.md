## StacsYak Messaging Service

This is a structured single-page web application for a messaging service. I used an API to access remote data that feeds into a client I wrote. 

Itâ€™s called StacsYak and it lets the users post messages, called Yaks, to a server and read the Yaks other people post. The StacsYak system is based around a server-side Web API that can be used to post Yaks, read all the current Yaks, and delete Yaks. It can also be used to up vote and down vote Yaks, and get information about the users of the system. Each user needs a user id allowing them to access the StacsYak API.

This application consists of client-side Javascript with API calls.
